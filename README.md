Weather Analysis with Matplotlib
Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing weather data using Python's Matplotlib library. The goal is to provide insights into various weather parameters over time, such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity. The analysis includes plotting time series data, comparing different weather metrics, and identifying trends and anomalies.

Features
Time Series Analysis: Visualize weather data over time to observe trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies.
Comparative Analysis: Compare different weather metrics (e.g., temperature vs. humidity) using scatter plots and line graphs.
Statistical Insights: Display statistical summaries and correlations between weather variables.
Customizable Visuals: Generate various types of plots, including line charts, bar charts, and histograms, to represent weather data effectively.
Data
The dataset used for this analysis includes daily weather observations such as:

Date
Temperature (High/Low)
Humidity
Precipitation
Wind Speed
The data can be sourced from public weather APIs or CSV files containing historical weather data.

Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/weather-analysis.git](https://github.com/nithiritgithup/Climate-Analysis-of-Austin-and-Seattle)
cd weather-analysis
Install Required Packages:
Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can use pip to install them:

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy
Prepare the Data:

Place your weather data file (weather_data.csv) in the data directory.
Run the Analysis:

Execute the weather_analysis.py script to generate the visualizations:
bash
Copy code
python weather_analysis.py
Example Visualizations
Temperature Trends: Line plot showing daily temperature changes over a month.
Humidity vs. Temperature: Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between humidity and temperature.
Monthly Precipitation: Bar chart displaying total precipitation for each month.
Files
weather_analysis.py: Python script containing the Matplotlib code for weather data visualization.
data/weather_data.csv: Sample dataset with weather observations.
plots/: Directory where generated plots are saved.
